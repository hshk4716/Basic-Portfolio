<h1>About me</h1>

</section>
<p>
<section id="text">
I graduated from UIC with a Biology degree. I realized half way through the program that I hated Science so I've decided to pursue a career in the technology field.
<p>

I have a parrot named Sunny. He is a sun conure, which I've learned is the loudest breed in the world for parrots. I've travelled to Pakistan, Dubai, Mexico, Canada and France. I hope to make more trips in the future!
